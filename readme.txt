Q1 Number Generator:

	The goal is to create a randomized dataset of 997940 numbers with values 1 to 20 with each number requiring a certain distribution amount, given in a table provided. No two consecutive numbers may be the same. The generated dataset needs to be output to a text file named test.output, one value per line. The console should display lines where the number 20 appears.

	To accomplish this goal, I started by building an empty HashMap to place the values, and an ArrayList containing possible indexes in the HashMap, 1-997940. While iterating through the numbers 1-12, I used Random() to select an available index value in my ArrayList and place each number in the HashMap at the respective index. Before placing each number, the index is checked to make sure the adjacent numbers are not the same. If the numbers are the same, a new index is selected. Each number 1-12 is distributed 83000 times. Next, using a list of distribution amounts for the remaining number values 13-20, each number is again placed at random in the HashMap using the same process as before, except each number is distrbuted before proceeding to the next, rather than iterating 13-20 each time. The end result is then output to a text file using a Buffered Writer, and instances of 20 are displayed to the command line.
